# ADC-based-PWM-Control-using-Potentiometer-and-PIC
This project uses a PIC microcontroller to read analog input from a potentiometer and adjust PWM output in real-time. The ADC converts voltage to a 10-bit value, which controls the PWM duty cycle. Useful for learning ADC and PWM concepts in motor control, LED dimming, and embedded systems.
